## Github Tips

- Closing the issue when the pull request gets closed or merged:

```
Closes #[ReferenceTo]

Description
```

- When making a pull request, make it **small and efficient**

- If you want to get feedback on the work sooner, **Convert to draft** -> when not ready for proper review to get merged in

- Doing a to-do list in the pull request or the issue shows the progress helps
